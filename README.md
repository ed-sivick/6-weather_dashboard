# Weather Dashboard  
___
## Objective
Build a weather dashboard using weather data from [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to view current and future weather for a city.  The user will be able to input cities and view its relative weather data.  The city name, date, and weather icon representing the weather on the current date will appear.  The temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index will also appear below the city name and date.  The UV index will be color coded to identify the severity: favorable(green), moderate(yellow), or severe(orange-red-violet). The future weather will be displayed as a 5-day forecast displaying the date; a weather icon representing the weather on that date; the temperature, and the humidity.  The user will be able to click on a city stored in the search history, and again view its current and future weather.  When re-opening the app, it will display the current and future weather for the last city that was searched.  If there were no cities searched, it will display the weather for New York, New York.
